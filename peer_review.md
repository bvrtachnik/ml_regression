### 1. Clarity & Organization  
The notebook is well-structured and clearly labeled by section, making it easy to follow the flow of the analysis. Each step — from imports and loading the data to training models and evaluating results — is clearly explained with comments. The use of markdown cells for section headings and reflections helps separate code from interpretation, which improves readability.

### 2. Feature Selection & Justification  
The selected features (such as horsepower and weight) make sense for predicting miles per gallon (mpg), and the addition of `power_to_weight` was a logical and well-justified feature engineering choice. Correlation visualizations supported these decisions, and the rationale was explained clearly in the reflection.

---

### 3. Model Performance & Comparisons  
Multiple models were compared side by side, and results were evaluated using standard metrics (R², RMSE, MAE). The combined horsepower + weight model performed best, and the pipeline experiments were thoughtfully designed. The negative R² on Pipeline 2 was acknowledged and discussed as a sign of overfitting, which shows a solid grasp of regression modeling concepts.

### 4. Reflection Quality  
Reflections throughout the notebook were honest, relevant, and showed thoughtful analysis. Section 6 did a great job of summarizing findings and acknowledging both technical and analytical challenges. The idea of testing the model on international datasets was a great forward-looking insight.

### Overall Feedback  
The notebook was clear, methodical, and grounded in the analysis. All required components were completed and presented cleanly. Everything was easy to follow and informative throughout.
